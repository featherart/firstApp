This is a practice Node app that uploads an image file and displays it

No frameworks were used, just vanilla Node to understand the basic parts and how they fit together

This follows the Node Beginner Book tutorial

To run it: clone repo, npm install then start server with node index.js at the command line

When server starts go to http://localhost:8888/start then select a .png file to upload

Handy tip: for a wealth of small .png files go to http://exquisitercorpse.herokuapp.com/drawings
